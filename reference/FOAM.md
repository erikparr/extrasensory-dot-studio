Granular / Sequencer / MIDI Triggering gives full control for sonic expression: from hyper-rhythms to granulated masses of shifting vocal fragments.

Trigger phonemes from pads/keys, or lock them into rhythmic patterns with the built-in step sequencer (4 / 8 / 16 steps). 

Designed for Sound Design

From clean vocal fragments to stutters, glitch consonants, vowel pads, and impossible mouth-noise textures.
